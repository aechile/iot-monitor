- **Dynamic Dashboards:** Create dynamic & reusable dashboards with template variables that appear as dropdowns at the top of the dashboard.
- **Explore Metrics:** Explore your data through ad-hoc queries and dynamic drilldown. Split view and compare different time ranges, queries and data sources side by side.
- **Explore Logs:** Experience the magic of switching from metrics to logs with preserved label filters. Quickly search through all your logs or streaming them live.
- **Alerting:** Visually define alert rules for your most important metrics. IoT-MONITOR will continuously evaluate and send notifications to systems like Slack, PagerDuty, VictorOps, OpsGenie.
- **Mixed Data Sources:** Mix different data sources in the same graph! You can specify a data source on a per-query basis. This works for even custom datasources.
